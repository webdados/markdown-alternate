# Markdown Alternate

A WordPress plugin that provides markdown versions of posts and pages for LLMs and users who prefer clean, structured content over HTML. Read the [announcement blog post](https://joost.blog/markdown-alternate/) for the full story.

## Features

- Access any post at `/post-slug.md`
- Access any page at `/page-slug.md`
- Nested pages work: `/parent/child.md`
- Date-based permalinks supported: `/2024/01/my-post.md`
- Content negotiation: Use `Accept: text/markdown` header on any post/page URL
- Zero configuration required

## Installation

### For Users

1. Download the plugin ZIP file
2. Upload to `/wp-content/plugins/markdown-alternate/`
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
4. Visit any post or page URL with `.md` extension

### For Developers

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ProgressPlanner/markdown-alternate.git
cd markdown-alternate
composer install
```

## Usage

### Via URL Extension

Simply append `.md` to any post or page URL:

```bash
# Get a post as markdown
curl https://example.com/hello-world.md

# Get a nested page as markdown
curl https://example.com/about/team.md
```

### Via Content Negotiation

Request markdown using the `Accept` header on the original URL:

```bash
curl -H "Accept: text/markdown" https://example.com/hello-world/
```

### Via Query Parameter

For clients that cannot send custom headers, use the `format` query parameter:

```bash
curl https://example.com/hello-world/?format=markdown
```

Note: The value must be exactly `markdown` (lowercase, case-sensitive).

### Markdown Output Format

```markdown
---
title: "Post Title"
date: 2026-01-30
author: "Author Name"
featured_image: "https://example.com/image.jpg"
categories:
  - name: "Category A"
    url: "/category/category-a.md"
  - name: "Category B"
    url: "/category/category-b.md"
tags:
  - name: "tag1"
    url: "/tag/tag1.md"
---
# Post Title

Post content converted to markdown...
```

## Content Processing

The plugin processes WordPress content to produce clean markdown:

- **Code blocks**: Syntax highlighting markup (e.g., `<span class="hljs-keyword">`) added by plugins like Highlight.js or Prism is automatically stripped. The output contains only the raw code with language hints preserved for fenced code blocks.
- **HTML entities**: Entities like `&amp;` and `&#8217;` in titles and metadata are decoded to their actual characters.
- **Shortcodes and blocks**: Standard WordPress shortcodes and Gutenberg blocks are rendered before conversion.

## Requirements

- WordPress 6.0 or higher
- PHP 7.4 or higher
- Pretty permalinks enabled (Settings > Permalinks - any option except "Plain")

## Development

### Running Tests

## For Developers

### Custom Post Type Support

By default, only posts and pages serve markdown. To enable markdown for custom post types, use the `markdown_alternate_supported_post_types` filter:

```php
add_filter( 'markdown_alternate_supported_post_types', function( $types ) {
    $types[] = 'book';      // Add your custom post type
    $types[] = 'portfolio'; // Add multiple types
    return $types;
} );
```

Once added, the custom post type will:
- Serve markdown at `.md` URLs (e.g., `/my-book.md`)
- Respond to `Accept: text/markdown` headers
- Respond to `?format=markdown` query parameter
- Include `<link rel="alternate">` tag in HTML head
