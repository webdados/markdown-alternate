## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Admin settings page | Zero-config by design — works out of the box |
| Markdown-to-HTML conversion | One direction only (HTML -> Markdown) |
| Custom output templates | Fixed format for simplicity and consistency |
| Caching layer | Rely on WordPress/server caching |
| Multisite-specific features | Standard WordPress APIs should work; explicit support deferred |
